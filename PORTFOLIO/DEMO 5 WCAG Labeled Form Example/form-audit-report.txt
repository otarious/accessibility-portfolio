Accessibility Audit Report: Form Labels

Issue:
Input fields do not have associated <label> elements.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)

Impact:
Screen reader users cannot determine the purpose of each field, making the form inaccessible for visually impaired users.

Recommendation:
Add descriptive <label> elements for each input field and associate them using the "for" attribute and matching input IDs.

Result:
The form is now fully accessible and usable by screen reader users, compliant with WCAG 2.1.
