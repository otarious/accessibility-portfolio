Accessibility Audit Report: Keyboard Navigation

Issue:
Links have no visible focus indicator, making it difficult for keyboard-only users to know which element is active.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible)

Impact:
Keyboard users cannot visually track their location on the page, reducing accessibility and usability.

Recommendation:
Provide a clear, visible focus style (e.g., outline or background) for all interactive elements.

Result:
All links now have a visible focus indicator, making the page accessible and easy to use with a keyboard.
