Accessibility Audit Report: Descriptive Buttons and Links

Issue:
Button and link text are not descriptive (e.g., "Click", "Here").

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose)

Impact:
Screen reader users and people with cognitive disabilities may not understand the purpose of these controls, making navigation confusing.

Recommendation:
Use descriptive text for all buttons and links, clearly indicating their purpose.

Result:
The button and link now have clear, meaningful labels, making the page accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
