Accessibility Audit Report: Color Contrast Issue

Issue:
Very low color contrast on price text (color: #e0e0e0 on white background).

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast, Minimum)

Impact:
Users with visual impairments or color blindness may not be able to read the price information.

Recommendation:
Change the text color from #e0e0e0 to #222 to provide sufficient contrast and meet accessibility standards.

Result:
Text is now clear, readable, and accessible to all users. The page is compliant with WCAG 2.1 color contrast guidelines.
