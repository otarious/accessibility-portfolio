Accessibility Audit Report: Visible Focus Indicator

Issue:
Links do not have a visible focus indicator, making it impossible for keyboard users to see which link is selected.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible)

Impact:
Keyboard users lose track of navigation and cannot operate the site efficiently.

Recommendation:
Provide a clear, visible focus style (outline or box-shadow) for all interactive elements.

Result:
All links now have a highly visible focus indicator, making navigation accessible for all users.
