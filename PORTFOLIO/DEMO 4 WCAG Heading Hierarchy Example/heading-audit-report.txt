Accessibility Audit Report: Heading Structure

Issue:
Heading elements are not in a logical hierarchical order (e.g., skipping from <h1> to <h3> and <h5>).

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)

Impact:
Screen reader and keyboard users may have difficulty understanding the page structure, making navigation confusing.

Recommendation:
Use headings (<h1> to <h6>) in a logical order without skipping levels, to create clear content hierarchy and improve accessibility.

Result:
The page now has a proper heading structure that is easy to navigate for all users and compliant with WCAG 2.1.
