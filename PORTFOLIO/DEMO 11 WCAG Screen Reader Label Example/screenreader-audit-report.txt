Accessibility Audit Report: Screen Reader Compatibility

Issue:
Button with only an icon is missing an accessible label and cannot be interpreted by screen reader users.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)

Impact:
Screen reader users cannot determine the button's purpose, making it inaccessible.

Recommendation:
Add an aria-label to the button and mark the visual icon as aria-hidden.

Result:
The button is now fully accessible and clearly described by screen readers.
