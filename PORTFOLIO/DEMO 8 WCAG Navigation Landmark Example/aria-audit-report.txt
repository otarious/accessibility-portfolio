Accessibility Audit Report: ARIA Attributes

Issue:
Navigation region is not identified for assistive technology users.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)

Impact:
Screen reader users cannot easily locate or skip the navigation section, reducing usability.

Recommendation:
Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <nav>) and ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label) to clearly define navigation regions.

Result:
The navigation is now properly identified and accessible for all users, including those with assistive technology.
