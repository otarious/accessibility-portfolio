Accessibility Audit Report: Focusable Elements

Issue:
Custom interactive element (<div>) is not focusable for keyboard users.

WCAG Standard:
WCAG 2.1 â€“ Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard)

Impact:
Keyboard-only users cannot access or activate this element, resulting in poor accessibility.

Recommendation:
Add tabindex="0" to make the element focusable, and provide visible focus indication.

Result:
The element is now fully accessible and operable by keyboard, meeting WCAG 2.1 requirements.
